On Purpose and Passion: "Purpose is not something you find, but something you cultivate. It's an internal compass that guides your actions, your thoughts, and your dreams. The fire of passion fuels this purpose, driving you to wake up every morning with determination, knowing that every small step you take brings you closer to your vision. It's not always easy, but nothing worthwhile ever is. In the pursuit of purpose, you will discover the depths of your own potential, and in that discovery, you will find peace and fulfillment."
