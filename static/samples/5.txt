On Time and Patience: "Time is the most valuable resource we have, yet it is the one we often take for granted. Every second is an opportunity, a moment in which we can create, love, learn, or grow. But time also teaches us the virtue of patience. Not everything we desire will come to us immediately, and that is okay. The most beautiful things in life often take time to unfold. Patience allows us to appreciate the journey and trust that the right things will come at the right time. Do not rush the process; embrace it, and in time, everything will fall into place."
