On Strength and Resilience: "True strength is not measured by how much you can bear, but by how you rise after you've fallen. It is found in the quiet determination to keep moving forward, even when the road is difficult and the path unclear. Resilience is the ability to bend without breaking, to adapt and recover in the face of adversity. In every challenge, there is an opportunity to prove to yourself that you are capable of more than you ever imagined. The human spirit is incredibly powerful, and when driven by hope and courage, it can overcome any obstacle."
